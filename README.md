Commissions Galore

Target Market:
Content creators: Musicians, artists etc.
People looking to commission art, music etc.

User Stories:
As an artist, I want to directly create for people who might want to commission my work, so I've got more exposure to the market.

As a game dev, I want someone who can create content/ assets for me so I can focus on other aspects of development.
