# Target Market
* Content creators, musicians, concept artists, graphic designers.
* People looking to commission works of art

# User Stories
* As an artist, I want to directly create for people who might want to commission my work, so I've got more exposure to the market.
* As a game dev, I want someone who can create content/ assets for me so I can focus on other aspects of development.
